# Cracking the Coding Interview - 5th Edition #

As the solution in CC150 (Cracking the Coding Interview) is written in Java, here I provide a Python-written solution set which contains all the interview questions from Chapter 1 to Chapter 18 in the book. 

> Note: The book I used is the 5th Edition (150 Programming Questions)
